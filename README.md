Project Description:

As the Chief Data Scientist for my city's school district. In this capacity, I'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
As a first task, I've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I've been given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. It is my responsibility is to aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.

Data Source:
District and school data files are at link below:
https://github.com/amydach/pandas_homework/tree/master/PyCitySchools/Resources

Features:
Our finished project help's people explore the Olympic data.

Link to my Github repo:  https://github.com/amydach/pandas_homework

	* Select folder PyCitySchools to run Jypyter Notebook file PyCitySchools_Starter.ipynb.  
	* Review viewable Data Frames and a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

Dependencies:
Pandas
Jupyter Notebook

Usage:

Showcase trends in school and district performance.

My final report includes each of the following:

### District Summary

* Created a high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:
  * Total Schools
  * Total Students.  
  * Total Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

### School Summary

* Created an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

### Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)

* Created a table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate. Include:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

### Bottom Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)

* Created a table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate. Included all of the same metrics as above.

### Math Scores by Grade\*\*

* Created a table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Reading Scores by Grade

* Created a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Scores by School Spending

* Created a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Created 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. Included in the table each of the following:
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

### Scores by School Size

* Repeated the above breakdown, but this time grouped schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).

### Scores by School Type

* Repeated the above breakdown, but this time grouped schools based on school type (Charter vs. District).
